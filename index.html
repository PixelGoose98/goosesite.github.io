    <h2>Section 1: Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      This is a retro-style website im gonna use to host links to all my stuff. like my gamedevin projects and etc. so yeah! just have a look around or some shit.
    </p>

    <h2>Section 2: About me!</h2>
    <p>
      First! im a gamedev and i enjoy makin games with story but while being fun, like deltarune, the half life series, the portal series. I prioratise games bieng fun while having a deeper thing to take away from it. and ofc games with god fucking game design.
      id like to think im good at knowing what is a good video game and what isnt. but whatever, The liscenced engines i use are GameMaker Studio: 2, Unity, and unreal engine, and godot (yes i know all of these cause im based),
      and the engines i have made and use are gonna be linked below! i have 2d and 3d engines of quality similar to the source engine. some are currently a work in progress. like some of my games
      here that im gonna link and talk about. the languages i know are C (based and low level but sometimes dont prefer it), C++ (a little strange to read), C# (alright), java (annoying), Haxe (ive never used this), HolyC (doesnt really have a use outside of templeos, RIP Terry Davis), and the following assembly languages: x86_64, 6502, 8086), i know GML (gamemaker language), and many more.

      my idols: Toby Fox (My beloved).
